Now will this be just another post that will just use up space in the interwebs?

**Confidence.**

If there is one quality an entity should have, it is confidence. The title of this post just shows the lack of it. Lacking confidence is one of the ??? for ones' self interest.
You may be very good at what you do, if you lack the said quality, you'll seem mediocre. [^1]

> Confidence is marketing yourself.

I'm not just saying that it only applies IRL (in real life), it may also be how you present yourself in the world wide web, and maybe in the future, inside virtual reality.

Now anonymous aka anon has got him/her/it some confidence!
Is it the disregard of judgement that makes an anon ooze confidence. Though most of the time, confidence is used in an unethical way like verbally abusing others. It is still confidence and we can learn something from that. We are afraid of being judged when there is a face tied to it --- your face.

[^1]: tl;dr. Be Confident
