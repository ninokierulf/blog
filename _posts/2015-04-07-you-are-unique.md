>&quot;You are unique. Just like everyone else.&quot;
><small><cite title="Anonymous">Anonymous</cite></small>

People strive to be unique aside from everybody else.
I'm not saying it's bad. But is it that bad to be not? To be average and the same. To have common interests and skills to share and be able to relate with?

Am I suggesting you to be mediocre? No! I'm just saying that its not bad to not be unique.

It's so ironic that everyone wants to be unique, that it becomes what it's trying not to be -- not unique.

PS: I need to work on my synonyms.
